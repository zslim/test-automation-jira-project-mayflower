# Testing Jira with automated tests - project team Mayflower

This repo is alive from the 2nd sprint of the Jira testing project.

## About the project
This is our first testing project ever. We've never planned any tests before and never programmed any except for unit tests for our development projects.
In the 1st sprint we planned tests based on the requirements [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/132JnG0T5nDWgDr6_mtS_8rw2mfvFx5eqj_yDMen8C9U/edit#gid=0 "Testing requirements"). From the 2nd sprint on we're automating these tests, fixing them first if necessary. For the automation we use Selenium WebDriver.

## About the project team
Team Mayflower consists of two wonderful students of [Codecool](https://codecool.com): [Krisztina Nagy](https://github.com/SzaffiCat/ "Kriszti's Github site") and [Zsófia Limbek](https://github.com/zslim/ "Zsófi's Github site"). After spending months working on projects with Python, Javascript and Java, we're doing the last quarter of our Codecool education, in which we're learning test automation.
